## Credit

YouTube tutorial by "TechWorld with Nana". Highly recommend it because she talks not only about syntax but explains why Go was even developed, its use cases or what Golang is used for, and how Go is different from other programming languages.

## What's Next

I plan on building a simple API using GoLang next.
